Does a greybody fit to Herschel PACS, SPIRE and other continuum lines in order to calculate the FIR Intensity from 40-500 microns. 
Writes a .csv file with the intensities which can be used in the plotting script, also creates dust temperature, tau and FIR .fits maps based on the plots
Some switches are included to allow for cropping of the input files and plotting outputs. The CII Intensity is propagated cause the output is used for CII vs FIR Intensity relations
for the FEEDBACK (Schneider et al., 2020) project.
